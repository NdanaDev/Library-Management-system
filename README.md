# Library Management System

## Overview

The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a software application designed to effectively organize, store, and manage information related to books, periodicals, and other media. Its primary goal is to provide a centralized platform for:

- Managing library resources
- Tracking book loans and returns
- Streamlining the overall operations of a library

The system supports both library staff (for inventory management) and patrons (for searching and borrowing materials).
